\section{GLUT1 localization}
\section{Leakiness and loss of GLUT1 expression}
%When culturing cells in medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), please note that many lots of FBS contain tetracycline as FBS is generally isolated from cows that have been fed a diet containing tetracycline. If you culture your cells in medium containing FBS that is not reduced in tetracycline, you may observe low basal expression of your gene of interest in the absence of tetracycline

%Tetracycline (MW = 444.4) is commonly used as a broad spectrum antibiotic and acts to inhibit translation by blocking polypeptide chain elongation in bacteria. In the T-REx? System, tetracycline is used as an inducing agent to induce transcription of the gene of interest from the inducible expression vector. Tetracycline induces transcription by binding to the Tet repressor homodimer and causing the repressor to undergo a conformational change that renders it unable to bind to the Tet operator. The association constant of tetracycline to the Tet repressor is 3 x 109 M-1 (Takahashi et al., 1991). 

%Tetracycline is light sensitive

%You may want to vary the concentration of tetracycline (0.1 to 1 µg/ml) and time of exposure to tetracycline (8 to 24 hours) to optimize or modulate expression for your cell line.

%Stable cell lines often lose their protein expression with time as a result of a heterogeneity in the transfected population of cells. A more homogeneous population of cells can be obtained by limiting dilution cloning or picking individual colonies of drug-resistant cells.

% selection used by the landhaler lab; one population might overgrow another, causing the increased leaky expression over time.

Because the loss of expression over time was observed in a sub-population of both wild-type and mutant cells (Figure%figure! 
, new cells were thaw and the expression of GLUT1 variants were analyzed again with Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. (Supplementary Figure%figure!
