\section{Assessment of GLUT1 inducible expression}
Previous results from the work of our laboratory showed that the GLUT1\textsuperscript{P485L} mutation leads to specific interaction with clathrins and internalization of the protein. In order to further investigate the role and functional effects of the mutation, we generated two HEK293 stable cells that express epitope tagged full length wild-type and mutant GLUT1 upon induction by doxycycline. 

To determine the optimal conditions for inducible expression, GLUT1 wild-type and mutant cells were grown in different concentrations of doxycycline for 24 hr and the expression of GLUT1 protein was analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that (Figure~)
