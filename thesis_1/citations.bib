	Abstract = {Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a well-characterized plasma membrane protein that travels between the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments. Although TfR itself should undergo degradation, the same as other intracellular proteins, whether a specific TfR degradation pathway exists has never been investigated. In this study, we screened small GTPase Rab proteins, common regulators of membrane traffic in all eukaryotes, for proteins that are specifically involved in TfR degradation. We performed the screening by three sequential methods, i.e. colocalization of Rab with TfR, colocalization with lysosomes, and knockdown of Rab by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), and succeeded in identifying Rab12, a previously uncharacterized Rab isoform, as a prime candidate among the 60 human or mouse Rabs screened. We showed that expression of a constitutive active mutant of Rab12 reduced the amount of TfR protein, whereas functional ablation of Rab12 by knockdown of either Rab12 itself or its upstream activator Dennd3 increased the amount of TfR protein. Interestingly, however, knockdown of Rab12 had no effect on the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein, i.e. on a conventional degradation pathway. Our findings indicated that TfR is constitutively degraded by a Rab12-dependent pathway (presumably from recycling endosomes to lysosomes), which is independent of the conventional degradation pathway.},

@article{Weston,
	Abstract = {Recent studies of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) have greatly advanced our understanding of the important role this protein plays in the establishment and progression of inflammatory disease. To facilitate more detailed studies on the function of VAP-1, we developed a GFP-fusion protein that enabled us to monitor the trafficking of the protein in three selected cell types: hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, liver myofibroblasts and an hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2). The fusion protein was detected as punctate cytoplasmic GFP staining, but was present only at low levels at the cell surface in all cell types studied. The subcellular distribution of the protein was not altered in a catalytically inactive mutant form of the protein (Tyr471Phe) or in the presence of exogenous VAP-1 substrate (methylamine) or inhibitor (semicarbazide). The GFP-VAP-1 protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus (GM-130), endoplasmic reticulum (GRP94) and early endosomes (EEA-1). Additional staining for VAP-1 revealed that the overexpressed protein was also present in vesicles that were negative for GFP fluorescent signal and did not express EEA-1. We propose that these vesicles are responsible for recycling the fusion protein and that the fluorescence of the GFP moiety is quenched at the low pH within these vesicles. This feature of the protein makes it well suited for live cell imaging studies where we wish to track protein that is being actively trafficked within the cell in preference to that which is being recycled.},

@article{Senkel,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To analyze gene function in mammalian cells tetracycline inducible expression of a gene-of-interest at a specific genomic location (Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}) is most attractive. However, leakiness of basal transgene expression and artificially high expression level upon tetracycline addition may be disadvantageous. FINDINGS: To solve these problems, we developed two different approaches to improve our pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}expressing the tissue restricted transcription factor HNF4αunder control of tetracycline. On the one hand we replaced the strong full length CMV promoter (CMV-Wt) with a weaker 5'-deleted CMV promoter fragment of 138 nucleotides in length (CMV-138). On the other hand we extended our INS-1 Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}cell lines with a Shield-1 dependent conditional control system of protein stability. Therefore, we fused HNF4αto the destabilization domain (DD) deduced from human FKBP12 protein. As a result in both approaches basal transgene expression level was markedly reduced, but HNF4αinduction could still be maintained. Additionally, we could show that a low increase in HNF4αinduces caspase activity indicating an apoptotic effect of HNF4αin these cells. CONCLUSION: In the present study we considerably improved our INS-1 Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}cell lines conditionally expressing HNF4αto reduce leakiness and to optimize exogenous HNF4αprotein expression to a physiological level. As an important result we could extend our previous results that HNF4αinduces apoptosis in the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 with the new aspect that an expression level of the HNF4αtransgene marginally exceeding the endogenous level is sufficient to trigger apoptosis.},

@article{Pham,
	Abstract = {Tetracycline-regulated expression systems have been widely used for inducible protein expression in cultured mammalian cells. With these systems, however, leakiness in expression of the target gene in the absence of the inducing agent is a frequent problem. Here we describe a novel approach to overcome this problem that involves the incorporation of AU-rich mRNA destabilizing elements (AREs) into the 3' untranslated regions of the tetracycline-inducible constructs. Using the inducible expression of sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 in HEK293 cells as model systems, we found this ARE approach to be remarkably successful in ablating expression of these proteins in the absence of doxycycline through decreasing stability of their mRNAs. We show that this undemanding and flexible process results in a substantial decrease in the leakiness of the tetracycline-inducible expression system while maintaining a high level of target protein expression following induction.},

@article{Yamamoto,
	Abstract = {We studied the effects of bafilomycin A1, a potent and specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), on the process of autophagy in rat hepatoma cell line, H-4-II-E cells. To induce autophagy, cells were transferred from Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 12% fetal calf serum into Hanks' balanced salt solution. When bafilomycin A1 was added to Hanks' balanced salt solution, endogenous protein degradation was strongly inhibited and numerous autophagosomes accumulated in H-4-II-E cells, whereas autolysosomes decreased in number. Acid phosphatase activity was not detected in the autophagosomes which accumulated in the presence of bafilomycin A1, suggesting that fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes was disturbed by this drug. Inhibition of the fusion was reversible, and the autophagosomes changed into autolysosomes after the removal of the inhibitor. Bafilomycin A1 also prevented the appearance of endocytosed HRP in autophagic vacuoles. These results suggested that acidification of the lumenal space of autophagosomes or lysosomes by V-ATPase is important for the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.},

@article{Tanida,
	Abstract = {During starvation-induced autophagy in mammals, autophagosomes form and fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of the intra-autophagosomal contents by lysosomal proteases. During the formation of autophagosomes, LC3 is lipidated, and this LC3-phospholipid conjugate (LC3-II) is localized on autophagosomes and autolysosomes. While intra-autophagosomal LC3-II may be degraded by lysosomal hydrolases, recent studies have regarded LC3-II accumulation as marker of autophagy. The effect of lysosomal turnover of endogenous LC3-II in this process, however, has not been considered. We therefore investigated the lysosomal turnover of endogenous LC3-II during starvation-induced autophagy using E64d and pepstatin A, which inhibit lysosomal proteases, including cathepsins B, D and L. We found that endogenous LC3-II significantly accumulated in the presence of E64d and pepstatin A under starvation conditions, increasing about 3.5 fold in HEK293 cells and about 6.7 fold in HeLa cells compared with that in their absence, whereas the amount of LC3-II in their absence is cell-line dependent. Morphological analyses indicated that endogenous LC3-positive puncta and autolysosomes increased in HeLa cells under starvation conditions in the presence of these inhibitors. These results indicate that endogenous LC3-II is considerably degraded by lysosomal hydrolases after formation of autolysosomes, and suggest that lysosomal turnover, not a transient amount, of this protein reflects starvation-induced autophagic activity.},

	Abstract = {Tetracycline-resistance determinants encoding active efflux of the drug are widely distributed in gram-negative bacteria and unique with respect to genetic organization and regulation of expression. Each determinant consists of two genes called tetA and tetR, which are oriented with divergent polarity, and between them is a central regulatory region with overlapping promoters and operators. The amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins are 43-78% identical. The resistance protein TetA is a tetracycline/metal-proton antiporter located in the cytoplasmic membrane, while the regulatory protein TetR is a tetracycline inducible repressor. TetR binds via a helix-turn-helix motif to the two tet operators, resulting in repression of both genes. A detailed model of the repressor-operator complex has been proposed on the basis of biochemical and genetic data. The tet genes are differentially regulated so that repressor synthesis can occur before the resistance protein is expressed. This has been demonstrated for the Tn10-encoded tet genes and may be a common property of all tet determinants, as suggested by the similar locations of operators with respect to promoters. Induction is mediated by a tetracycline-metal complex and requires only nanomolar concentrations of the drug. This is the most sensitive effector-inducible system of transcriptional regulation known to date. The crystal structure of the TetR-tetracycline/metal complex shows the Tet repressor in the induced, non-DNA binding conformation. The structural interpretation of many noninducible TetR mutants has offered insight into the conformational changes associated with the switch between inducing and repressing structures of TetR. Tc is buried in the core of TetR, where it is held in place by multiple contacts to the protein.},

Before performing the analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS), nanoelectrospray-MS/MS (NanoES-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-MS/MS (LC-MS/MS), the peptide mixtures need to be cleaned, concentrated and often selectively enriched or pre-fractionated, for which we employ simple, self-made and extremely economical stop-and-go-extraction tips (StageTips). StageTips are ordinary pipette tips containing very small disks made of beads with reversed phase, cation-exchange or anion-exchange surfaces embedded in a Teflon mesh. The fixed nature of the beads allows flexible combination of disks with different surfaces to obtain multi-functional tips. Disks containing different surface functionalities and loose beads such as titania and zirconia for phosphopeptide enrichment can be combined. Incorporation into an automated workflow has also been demonstrated. Desalting and concentration takes approximately 5 min while fractionation or enrichment takes approximately 30 min.},

	Abstract = {Protein quantification without isotopic labels has been a long-standing interest in the proteomics field. However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS signals, given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. For a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detected the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with greater precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications was obtained via a t test approach. For a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitude, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to many biological questions; it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in a manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button.},

	Abstract = {The Hippo pathway regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis in response to multiple stimuli, including cell density and mechanotransduction. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatases can also stimulate Hippo signaling in cell culture. We defined the Hippo protein-protein interaction network with and without inhibition of serine and threonine phosphatases by okadaic acid. We identified 749 protein interactions, including 599 previously unrecognized interactions, and demonstrated that several interactions with serine and threonine phosphatases were phosphorylation-dependent. Mutation of the T-loop of MST2 (mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 2), which prevented autophosphorylation, disrupted its association with STRIPAK (striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex). Deletion of the amino-terminal forkhead-associated domain of SLMAP (sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein), a component of the STRIPAK complex, prevented its association with MST1 and MST2. Phosphatase inhibition produced temporally distinct changes in proteins that interacted with MOB1A and MOB1B (Mps one binder kinase activator-like 1A and 1B) and promoted interactions with upstream Hippo pathway proteins, such as MST1 and MST2, and with the trimeric protein phosphatase 6 complex (PP6). Mutation of three basic amino acids that are part of a phospho-serine- and phospho-threonine-binding domain in human MOB1B prevented its interaction with MST1 and PP6 in cells treated with okadaic acid. Collectively, our results indicated that changes in phosphorylation orchestrate interactions between kinases and phosphatases in Hippo signaling, providing a putative mechanism for pathway regulation.},

	Abstract = {Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) can occur in isolation or in association with epilepsy, but the genetic causes and pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. We performed a clinical evaluation and genetic analysis in a five-generation family with co-occurrence of PED and epilepsy (n = 39), suggesting that this combination represents a clinical entity. Based on a whole genome linkage analysis we screened SLC2A1, encoding the glucose transporter of the blood-brain-barrier, GLUT1 and identified heterozygous missense and frameshift mutations segregating in this and three other nuclear families with a similar phenotype. PED was characterized by choreoathetosis, dystonia or both, affecting mainly the legs. Predominant epileptic seizure types were primary generalized. A median CSF/blood glucose ratio of 0.52 (normal >0.60) in the patients and a reduced glucose uptake by mutated transporters compared with the wild-type as determined in Xenopus oocytes confirmed a pathogenic role of these mutations. Functional imaging studies implicated alterations in glucose metabolism in the corticostriate pathways in the pathophysiology of PED and in the frontal lobe cortex in the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures. Three patients were successfully treated with a ketogenic diet. In conclusion, co-occurring PED and epilepsy can be due to autosomal dominant heterozygous SLC2A1 mutations, expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with GLUT1 deficiency and providing a potential new treatment option for this clinical syndrome.},

@article{Klepper.2,
	Abstract = {GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS, OMIM 606777) is a treatable epileptic encephalopathy resulting from impaired glucose transport into the brain. The essential biochemical finding is a low glucose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; hypoglycorrhachia; mean 1.7 [SD 0.3mmol/L]) in the setting of normoglycaemia. CSF lactate is normal. Patients present with an early-onset epilepsy resistant to anticonvulsants, developmental delay, and a complex movement disorder. Hypotonic, ataxic, and dystonic features are most prominent. Speech is often severely affected. Some patients develop spasticity and secondary microcephaly. The phenotype is highly variable ranging from severe impairment to children without seizures. Electroencephalography (EEG) may show 2.5-4Hz spike-waves improving on food intake. Neuroimaging is uninformative. Most patients carry heterozygous de novo mutations in the GLUT1 gene (OMIM 138140, gene map locus 1p35-31.3). Autosomal dominant transmission and several mutational hot spots have been identified, but phenotype-genotype correlations are not yet apparent. Homozygous GLUT1 mutations presumably are lethal. The ketogenic diet is the treatment of choice as it provides an alternative fuel to the brain. It should be introduced early and maintained into puberty. Seizures are effectively controlled with the onset of ketosis, but might recur and require comedication. The effect on neurodevelopment appears less impressive. The increasing number of patients, molecular and biochemical analysis, recent research into ketogenic diet mechanisms, and the development of animal models for GLUT1DS have brought substantial insights in disease manifestations and mechanisms. This review summarizes data on 84 published cases and highlights recent advances in understanding this entity.},

	N2 = {GLUT1 deficiency is caused by a defect in the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1. Impaired glucose transport across brain tissue barriers is reflected by hypoglycorrhachia and results in an epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delay and motor disorders. Recently heterozygous mutations in the GLUT1 gene (1p35--31.3) have been reported in sporadic patients. Parents and siblings carried the GLUT1 wild-type, suggesting a de novo, autosomal dominant condition resulting from GLUT1 haploinsufficiency. We report a father and two children from separate marriages affected by GLUT1 deficiency and carrying a novel heterozygous missense mutation (G272A) in the GLUT1 gene. Mutations were identified by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing and confirmed by restriction fragment digest. The predicted amino acid change (Gly91Asp) affects an Arg-X-Gly-Arg-Arg motif between helices 2 and 3 that represents a cytoplasmic anchor point and is highly conserved among transporters of the major facilitator superfamily down to yeast and bacteria. GLUT1 immunoreactivity was normal, but 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake into erythrocytes was significantly reduced, suggesting a quantitatively normal, but functionally impaired, GLUT1 protein at the cell membrane. This is the first report of autosomal dominant transmission of GLUT1 deficiency, confirming that this condition is the result of haploinsufficiency. The Gly→Asp mutation within a highly conserved sequence highlights its importance for GLUT1 function. GLUT1 deficiency should be considered in patients with epilepsy, mental retardation and motor disorders. Our observations have bearing on the identification of this treatable disorder in pediatric and adult patients, will modify current biochemical protocols which use parental controls and will enable genetic counseling of affected families.},

	Abstract = {Glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene in the majority of patients and results in impaired glucose transport into the brain. From 2004-2008, 132 requests for mutational analysis of the SLC2A1 gene were studied by automated Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Mutations in the SLC2A1 gene were detected in 54 patients (41%) and subsequently in three clinically affected family members. In these 57 patients we identified 49 different mutations, including six multiple exon deletions, six known mutations and 37 novel mutations (13 missense, five nonsense, 13 frame shift, four splice site and two translation initiation mutations). Clinical data were retrospectively collected from referring physicians by means of a questionnaire. Three different phenotypes were recognized: (i) the classical phenotype (84%), subdivided into early-onset (<2 years) (65%) and late-onset (18%); (ii) a non-classical phenotype, with mental retardation and movement disorder, without epilepsy (15%); and (iii) one adult case of glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome with minimal symptoms. Recognizing glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome is important, since a ketogenic diet was effective in most of the patients with epilepsy (86%) and also reduced movement disorders in 48% of the patients with a classical phenotype and 71% of the patients with a non-classical phenotype. The average delay in diagnosing classical glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome was 6.6 years (range 1 month-16 years). Cerebrospinal fluid glucose was below 2.5 mmol/l (range 0.9-2.4 mmol/l) in all patients and cerebrospinal fluid : blood glucose ratio was below 0.50 in all but one patient (range 0.19-0.52). Cerebrospinal fluid lactate was low to normal in all patients. Our relatively large series of 57 patients with glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome allowed us to identify correlations between genotype, phenotype and biochemical data. Type of mutation was related to the severity of mental retardation and the presence of complex movement disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid : blood glucose ratio was related to type of mutation and phenotype. In conclusion, a substantial number of the patients with glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome do not have epilepsy. Our study demonstrates that a lumbar puncture provides the diagnostic clue to glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome and can thereby dramatically reduce diagnostic delay to allow early start of the ketogenic diet.},

	Abstract = {The glucose transporter is now identified but may have modifications or other subunits that control its activity. The kinetics and inhibitor binding studies are consistent with the carrier model with different degrees of asymmetry and a single binding site that varies in specificity depending on the conformation of the protein. The physical structure could actually be quite different from the usual diagrams (rocking bananas), however, and could function as a monomer or higher oligomer. The binding site, or filter, that gives specificity could be in the middle as usually depicted; alternatively it could be entirely on the cytoplasmic side, where the protein is trypsin sensitive, and hydrophobic helices could span the membrane forming a simple channel. Possible restrictions on structures in the membrane from the hydrophobic nature of transmembrane segments of membrane proteins (62) may favor a globular domain outside the membrane as the binding site. Such speculations will have to await more structural information about the transporter.},

@article{Uldry,
	Abstract = {The SLC2 family of glucose and polyol transporters comprises 13 members, the glucose transporters (GLUT) 1--12 and the H+-myo-inositol cotransporter (HMIT). These proteins all contain 12 transmembrane domains with both the amino and carboxy-terminal ends located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and a N-linked oligosaccharide side-chain located either on the first or fifth extracellular loop. Based on sequence comparison, the GLUT isoforms can be grouped into three classes: class I comprises GLUT1--4; class II, GLUT6, 8, 10, and 12 and class III, GLUT5, 7, 9, 11 and HMIT. Despite their sequence similarity and the presence of class-specific signature sequences, these transporters carry various hexoses and HMIT is a H+/myo-inositol co-transporter. Furthermore, the substrate transported by some isoforms has not yet been identified. Tissue- and cell-specific expression of the well-characterized GLUT isoforms underlies their specific role in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis. Numerous studies with transgenic or knockout mice indeed support an important role for these transporters in the control of glucose utilization, glucose storage and glucose sensing. Much remains to be learned about the transport functions of the recently discovered isoforms (GLUT6--13 and HMIT) and their physiological role in the metabolism of glucose, myo-inositol and perhaps other substrates.},

	Abstract = {Internalization and trafficking of cell-surface membrane receptors and proteins into subcellular compartments is mediated by specific short-sequence signal motifs, which are usually located within the cytoplasmic domains of these receptor and protein molecules. The signals usually consist of short linear amino acid sequences, which are recognized by adaptor coat proteins along the endocytic and sorting pathways. The complex arrays of signals and recognition proteins ensure the dynamic movement, accurate trafficking, and designated distribution of transmembrane receptors and ligands into intracellular compartments, particularly to the endosomal-lysosomal system. This review summarizes the new information and concepts, integrating them with the current and established views of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and sorting of membrane receptors and proteins. Particular emphasis has been given to the functional roles of short-sequence signal motifs responsible for the itinerary and destination of membrane receptors and proteins moving into the subcellular compartments. The specific characteristics and functions of short-sequence motifs, including various tyrosine-based, dileucine-type, and other short-sequence signals in the trafficking and sorting of membrane receptors and membrane proteins are presented and discussed.},
