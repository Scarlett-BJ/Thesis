	Abstract = {The PDZ-domain-containing sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) promotes recycling of internalized transmembrane proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane by linking PDZ-dependent cargo recognition to retromer-mediated transport. Here, we employed quantitative proteomics of the SNX27 interactome and quantification of the surface proteome of SNX27- and retromer-suppressed cells to dissect the assembly of the SNX27 complex and provide an unbiased global view of SNX27-mediated sorting. Over 100 cell surface proteins, many of which interact with SNX27, including the glucose transporter GLUT1, the Menkes disease copper transporter ATP7A, various zinc and amino acid transporters, and numerous signalling receptors, require SNX27--retromer to prevent lysosomal degradation and maintain surface levels. Furthermore, we establish that direct interaction of the SNX27 PDZ domain with the retromer subunit VPS26 is necessary and sufficient to prevent lysosomal entry of SNX27 cargo. Our data identify the SNX27--retromer as a major endosomal recycling hub required to maintain cellular nutrient homeostasis.},

	Abstract = {Retromer is a protein assembly that orchestrates the sorting of transmembrane cargo proteins into endosome-to-Golgi and endosome-to-plasma-membrane transport pathways. Here, we have employed quantitative proteomics to define the interactome of human VPS35, the core retromer component. This has identified a number of new interacting proteins, including ankyrin-repeat domain 50 (ANKRD50), seriologically defined colon cancer antigen 3 (SDCCAG3) and VPS9-ankyrin-repeat protein (VARP, also known as ANKRD27). Depletion of these proteins resulted in trafficking defects of retromer-dependent cargo, but differential and cargo-specific effects suggested a surprising degree of functional heterogeneity in retromer-mediated endosome-to-plasma-membrane sorting. Extending this, suppression of the retromer-associated WASH complex did not uniformly affect retromer cargo, thereby confirming cargo-specific functions for retromer-interacting proteins. Further analysis of the retromer-VARP interaction identified a role for retromer in endosome-to-melanosome transport. Suppression of VPS35 led to mistrafficking of the melanogenic enzymes, tyrosinase and tryrosine-related protein 1 (Tyrp1), establishing that retromer acts in concert with VARP in this trafficking pathway. Overall, these data reveal hidden complexities in retromer-mediated sorting and open up new directions in our molecular understanding of this essential sorting complex.},

@article{Eyster,
	Abstract = {Clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) allows internalization of plasma membrane proteins lacking clathrin-targeting sequences, such as the major histocompatibility complex class I protein (MHCI), into cells. After internalization, vesicles containing MHCI fuse with transferrin-containing endosomes generated from clathrin-dependent endocytosis. In HeLa cells, MHCI is subsequently routed to late endosomes or recycled back out to the plasma membrane (PM) in distinctive tubular carriers. Arf6 is associated with endosomal membranes carrying CIE cargo and expression of an active form of Arf6 leads to the generation of vacuolar structures that trap CIE cargo immediately after endocytosis, blocking the convergence with transferrin-containing endosomes. We isolated these trapped vacuolar structures and analyzed their protein composition by mass spectrometry. Here we identify and validate six new endogenous cargo proteins (CD44, CD55, CD98, CD147, Glut1, and ICAM1) that use CIE to enter cells. CD55 and Glut1 appear to closely parallel the trafficking of MHCI, merging with transferrin endosomes before entering the recycling tubules. In contrast, CD44, CD98, and CD147 appear to directly enter the recycling tubules and by-pass the merge with EEA1-positive, transferrin-containing endosomes. This divergent itinerary suggests that sorting may occur along this CIE pathway. Furthermore, the identification of new cargo proteins will assist others studying CIE in different cell types and tissues.},

@article{Hesketh,
	Abstract = {VARP is a Rab32/38 effector that also binds to the endosomal/lysosomal R-SNARE VAMP7. VARP binding regulates VAMP7 participation in SNARE complex formation and can therefore influence VAMP7-mediated membrane fusion events. Mutant versions of VARP that cannot bind Rab32:GTP, designed on the basis of the VARP ankyrin repeat/Rab32:GTP complex structure described here, unexpectedly retain endosomal localization, showing that VARP recruitment is not dependent on Rab32 binding. We show that recruitment of VARP to the endosomal membrane is mediated by its direct interaction with VPS29, a subunit of the retromer complex, which is involved in trafficking from endosomes to the TGN and the cell surface. Transport of GLUT1 from endosomes to the cell surface requires VARP, VPS29, and VAMP7 and depends on the direct interaction between VPS29 and VARP. Finally, we propose that endocytic cycling of VAMP7 depends on its interaction with VARP and, consequently, also on retromer.},

However, little is known about the differentiation of human PSCs to BMECs. In the present study, human induced PSCs (iPSCs) were differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs), and further maturated to BMECs. Interestingly, C6 rat glioma cell-conditioned medium (C6CM), in addition to C6 co-culture, induced the differentiation of human iPSC-derived ECs (iPS-ECs) to BMEC-like cells, increase in the trans-endothelial electrical resistance, decreased in the dextran transport and up-regulation of gene expression of tight junction molecules in human iPS-ECs. Moreover, Wnt inhibitors attenuated the effects of C6CM. In summary, we have established a simple protocol of the generation of BMEC-like cells from human iPSCs, and have demonstrated that differentiation of iPS-ECs to BMEC-like cells is induced by C6CM-derived signals, including canonical Wnt signals.},

	N2 = {The human X-linked recessive disorder of copper metabolism, Menkes disease, is caused by a defect in the MNK (ATP7A) gene which encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting P-type ATPase (MNK). MNK is an important component of the mammalian copper transport pathway, and previous studies in cultured cells have localized MNK to the final compartment of the Golgi apparatus, the trans-Golgi network (TGN). At this location, MNK is predicted to supply copper to copper-dependent enzymes as they migrate through the secretory pathway. However, under conditions of elevated extracellular copper, the MNK protein undergoes a rapid relocalization to the plasma membrane where it functions in the efflux of copper from cells. In this study, three di-leucine motifs and a cluster of four acidic amino acids within the C-terminal region of MNK were investigated as candidate signals necessary for steady-state TGN localization. In vitro mutagenesis of the human MNK cDNA and immunofluorescence detection of mutant forms of MNK expressed in cultured cells demonstrated that the di-leucine, L1487L1488, was essential for localization of MNK within the TGN, but not for copper efflux. We suggest that this di-leucine motif is a putative endocytic targeting motif necessary for the retrieval of MNK from the plasma membrane to the TGN. Our data, along with the recent demonstration that the third transmembrane region of MNK functions as a TGN targeting signal, suggests that MNK localization to the TGN may be a two-step process involving TGN retention via the transmembrane region, and recycling to this compartment from the plasma membrane via the L1487L1488 motif.},

@article{Petris,
	Abstract = {Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive copper deficiency disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A ( MNK ) gene which encodes a copper transporting P-type ATPase (MNK). MNK is normally localized pre- dominantly in the trans -Golgi network (TGN); however, when cells are exposed to excessive copper it is rapidly relocalized to the plasma membrane where it functions in copper efflux. In this study, the c-myc epitope was introduced within the loop connecting the first and second transmembrane regions of MNK. This myc epitope allowed detection of the protein at the surface of living cells and provided the first experimental evidence supporting the common topological model. In cells stably expressing the tagged MNK protein (MNK-tag), extracellular antibodies were internalized to the perinuclear region, indicating that MNK-tag at the TGN constitutively cycles via the plasma membrane in basal copper conditions. Under elevated copper conditions, MNK-tag was recruited to the plasma membrane; however, internalization of MNK-tag was not inhibited and the protein continued to recycle through cyto- plasmic membrane compartments. These findings suggest that copper stimulates exocytic movement of MNK to the plasma membrane rather than reducing MNK retrieval and indicate that MNK may remove copper from the cytoplasm by transporting copper into the vesicles through which it cycles. Newly internalized MNK-tag and transferrin were found to co-localize, suggesting that MNK-tag follows a clathrin-coated pit/endosomal pathway into cells. Mutation of the di-leucine, L1487 L1488, prevented uptake of anti-myc antibodies in both basal and elevated copper conditions, thereby identifying this sequence as an endocytic signal for MNK. Analysis of the effects of the di-leucine mutation in elevated copper provided further support for copper-stimulated exocytic movement of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane.},

	Abstract = {Several receptors are downregulated by internalization after ligand binding. Regulation of T cell receptor (TCR) expression is an important step in T cell activation, desensitization, and tolerance induction. One way T cells regulate TCR expression is by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the TCR subunit clusters of differentiation (CD)3gamma. Thus, phosphorylation of CD3gamma serine 126 (S126) causes a downregulation of the TCR. In this study, we have analyzed the CD3gamma internalization motif in three different systems in parallel: in the context of the complete multimeric TCR; in monomeric CD4/CD3gamma chimeras; and in vitro by binding CD3gamma peptides to clathrin-coated vesicle adaptor proteins (APs). We find that the CD3gamma D127xxxLL131/132 sequence represents one united motif for binding of both AP-1 and AP-2, and that this motif functions as an active sorting motif in monomeric CD4/ CD3gamma molecules independently of S126. An acidic amino acid is required at position 127 and a leucine (L) is required at position 131, whereas the requirements for position 132 are more relaxed. The spacing between aspartic acid 127 (D127) and L131 is crucial for the function of the motif in vivo and for AP binding in vitro. Furthermore, we provide evidence indicating that phosphorylation of CD3gamma S126 in the context of the complete TCR induces a conformational change that exposes the DxxxLL sequence for AP binding. Exposure of the DxxxLL motif causes an increase in the TCR internalization rate and we demonstrate that this leads to an impairment of TCR signaling. On the basis of the present results, we propose the existence of at least three different types of L-based receptor sorting motifs.},

	Abstract = {The epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein module found primarily in proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Structural analyses and ligand-binding studies have shown that a set of proteins previously designated as harboring an ENTH domain in fact contain a highly similar, yet unique module referred to as an AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) domain. ENTH and ANTH (E/ANTH) domains bind both inositol phospholipids and proteins and contribute to the nucleation and formation of clathrin coats on membranes. ENTH domains also function in the development of membrane curvature through lipid remodeling during the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. E/ANTH-bearing proteins have recently been shown to function with adaptor protein-1 and GGA adaptors at the trans-Golgi network, which suggests that E/ANTH domains are universal components of the machinery for clathrin-mediated membrane budding.},

Lo et al. found that patients with an autoimmune disorder caused by deficiency of a protein called LRBA responded dramatically to the drug abatacept (see the Perspective by Sansom). Abatacept contains a segment of a potent inhibitory immune receptor, CTLA4. Experiments prompted by this observation revealed the relationship between the two proteins: LRBA controls the intracellular trafficking and degradation of CTLA4. This information may further improve patient care, because other clinically approved drugs have the desired mechanism of action with potentially fewer side effects.Science, this issue p. 436; see also p. 377Mutations in the LRBA gene (encoding the lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor protein) cause a syndrome of autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, and humoral immune deficiency. The biological role of LRBA in immunologic disease is unknown. We found that patients with LRBA deficiency manifested a dramatic and sustained improvement in response to abatacept, a CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4)--immunoglobulin fusion drug. Clinical responses and homology of LRBA to proteins controlling intracellular trafficking led us to hypothesize that it regulates CTLA4, a potent inhibitory immune receptor. We found that LRBA colocalized with CTLA4 in endosomal vesicles and that LRBA deficiency or knockdown increased CTLA4 turnover, which resulted in reduced levels of CTLA4 protein in FoxP3+ regulatory and activated conventional T cells. In LRBA-deficient cells, inhibition of lysosome degradation with chloroquine prevented CTLA4 loss. These findings elucidate a mechanism for CTLA4 trafficking and control of immune responses and suggest therapies for diseases involving the CTLA4 pathway.},

It is also involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. GTPase-activating protein (GAP) is a critical regulator of Arf function as it inactivates Arf. Here, we identified a novel species of GAP denoted as SMAP1 that preferentially acts on Arf6. Although overexpression of SMAP1 did not alter the subcellular distribution of the actin cytoskeleton, it did block the endocytosis of transferrin receptors. Knock down of endogenous SMAP1 also abolished transferrin internalization, which confirms that SMAP1 is needed for this endocytic process. SMAP1 overexpression had no effect on clathrin-independent endocytosis, however. Intriguingly, SMAP1 binds directly to the clathrin heavy chain via its clathrin-box and mutation studies revealed that its GAP domain and clathrin-box both contribute to the role SMAP1 plays in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. These observations suggest that SMAP1 may be an Arf6GAP that specifically regulates one of the multiple functions of Arf6, namely, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and that it does so by binding directly to clathrin.},

In the present study, SMAP2 is detected on the TGN in the pachytene spermatocyte to the round spermatid stages of spermatogenesis. Gene targeting reveals that SMAP2-deficient male mice are healthy and survive to adulthood but are infertile and exhibit globozoospermia. In SMAP2-deficient spermatids, the diameter of proacrosomal vesicles budding from TGN increases, TGN structures are distorted, acrosome formation is severely impaired, and reorganization of the nucleus does not proceed properly. CALM functions to regulate vesicle sizes, and this study shows that CALM is not recruited to the TGN in the absence of SMAP2. Furthermore, syntaxin2, a component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, is not properly concentrated at the site of acrosome formation. Thus this study reveals a link between SMAP2 and CALM/syntaxin2 in clathrin-coated vesicle formation from the TGN and subsequent acrosome formation.

Here, we identified a SMAP1 homologue that we named SMAP2. Like SMAP1, SMAP2 exhibits GAP activity and interacts with clathrin heavy chain (CHC). Furthermore, we show that SMAP2 interacts with the clathrin assembly protein CALM. Unlike SMAP1, however, SMAP2 appears to be a regulator of Arf1 in vivo, because cells transfected with a GAP-negative SMAP2 mutant were resistant to brefeldin A. SMAP2 colocalized with the adaptor proteins for clathrin AP-1 and EpsinR on the early endosomes/trans-Golgi-network (TGN). Moreover, overexpression of SMAP2 delayed the accumulation of TGN38/46 molecule on the TGN. This suggests that SMAP2 functions in the retrograde, early endosome-to-TGN pathway in a clathrin- and AP-1–dependent manner. Thus, the SMAP gene family constitutes an important ArfGAP subfamily, with each SMAP member exerting both common and distinct functions in vesicle trafficking.},

	Url = {http://www.jbc.org/content/290/10/6120.abstract N2 - Many G-protein-coupled receptors carry C-terminal ligand motifs for PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains; via interaction with PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins, this allows for integration of receptors into signaling complexes. However, the presence of PDZ domain proteins attached to intracellular membranes suggests that PDZ-type interactions may also contribute to subcellular sorting of receptors. The protein interacting specifically with Tc10 (PIST; also known as GOPC) is a trans-Golgi-associated protein that interacts through its single PDZ domain with a variety of cell surface receptors. Here we show that PIST controls trafficking of the interacting β1-adrenergic receptor both in the anterograde, biosynthetic pathway and during postendocytic recycling. Overexpression and knockdown experiments show that PIST leads to retention of the receptor in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), to the effect that overexpressed PIST reduces activation of the MAPK pathway by β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) agonists. Receptors can be released from retention in the TGN by coexpression of the plasma membrane-associated scaffold PSD-95, which allows for transport of receptors to the plasma membrane. Stimulation of β1 receptors and activation of the cAMP pathway lead to relocation of PIST from the TGN to an endosome-like compartment. Here PIST colocalizes with SNX1 and the internalized β1AR and protects endocytosed receptors from lysosomal degradation. In agreement, β1AR levels are decreased in hippocampi of PIST-deficient mice. Our data suggest that PIST contributes to the fine-tuning of β1AR sorting both during biosynthetic and postendocytic trafficking.},

Here we show that individual SNARE proteins involved in vesicle docking and fusion are regulated at both gene and protein expression upon stimulation with the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide. Focusing on two intracellular SNARE proteins, Vti1b and syntaxin 6 (Stx6), we show that they are up-regulated in conjunction with increasing cytokine secretion in activated macrophages and that their levels are selectively titrated to accommodate the volume and timing of post-Golgi cytokine trafficking. In macrophages, Vti1b and syntaxin 6 are localized on intracellular membranes and are present on isolated Golgi membranes and on Golgi-derived TNFα vesicles budded in vitro. By immunoprecipitation, we find that Vti1b and syntaxin 6 interact to form a novel intracellular Q-SNARE complex. Functional studies using overexpression of full-length and truncated proteins show that both Vti1b and syntaxin 6 function and have rate-limiting roles in TNFα trafficking and secretion. This study shows how macrophages have uniquely adapted a novel Golgi-associated SNARE complex to accommodate their requirement for increased cytokine secretion.},

We have generated green fluorescent protein variants of Rab9 and determined their localization in cultured cells. Rab9 is localized primarily in late endosomes and is readily distinguished from the trans-Golgi marker galactosyltransferase. Coexpression of fluorescent Rab9 and Rab7 revealed that these two late endosome Rabs occupy distinct domains within late endosome membranes. Cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors are enriched in the Rab9 domain relative to the Rab7 domain. TIP47 is likely to be present in this domain because it colocalizes with the receptors in fixed cells, and a TIP47 mutant disrupted endosome morphology and sequestered MPRs intracellularly. Rab9 is present on endosomes that display bidirectional microtubule-dependent motility. Rab9-positive transport vesicles fuse with the trans-Golgi network as followed by video microscopy of live cells. These data provide the first indication that Rab9-mediated endosome to trans-Golgi transport can use a vesicle (rather than a tubular) intermediate. Our data suggest that Rab9 remains vesicle associated until docking with the Golgi complex and is rapidly removed concomitant with or just after membrane fusion.},

	Abstract = {The retromer complex is a vital element of the endosomal protein sorting machinery that is conserved across all eukaryotes. Retromer is most closely associated with the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway and is necessary to maintain an active pool of hydrolase receptors in the trans-Golgi network. Recent progress in studies of retromer have identified new retromer-interacting proteins, including the WASH complex and cargo such as the Wntless/MIG-14 protein, which now extends the role of retromer beyond the endosome-to-Golgi pathway and has revealed that retromer is required for aspects of endosome-to-plasma membrane sorting and regulation of signalling events. The interactions between the retromer complex and other macromolecular protein complexes now show how endosomal protein sorting is coordinated with actin assembly and movement along microtubules, and place retromer squarely at the centre of a complex set of protein machinery that governs endosomal protein sorting. Dysregulation of retromer-mediated endosomal protein sorting leads to various pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and spastic paraplegia and the mechanisms underlying these pathologies are starting to be understood. In this Commentary, I will highlight recent advances in the understanding of retromer-mediated endosomal protein sorting and discuss how retromer contributes to a diverse set of physiological processes.},

A Leu paired with a second Leu, Ile, or Met, while itself lacking the ability to mediate transport, is the key structural feature in these motifs. Here we have studied the structural differences between the leucine-based motifs contained in the COOH tails of LIMPII and GLUT4, two membrane proteins that are transported through the secretory pathway and are targeted to lysosomes (1-3) and to a perinuclear compartment adjacent to the Golgi complex (4), respectively. LIMPII and GLUT4 display negatively (Asp470/Glu471) and positively (Arg484/Arg485) charged residues, respectively, at positions −4 and −5 upstream from the critical Leu residue. The change in the charge sign of residues −4 and −5 results in missorting of LIMPII and GLUT4. We note that the acidic Glu residue at position −4 is critical for efficient intracellular sorting of LIMPII to lysosomes, but is dispensable for its surface internalization by endocytosis. Efficient intracellular sorting and endocytosis of GLUT4 require an Arg pair between positions −4 and −7. These results are consistent with the existence of distinct leucine-based motifs and provide evidence of their different readings at different cellular sites.},

@article{Bonifacino,
	Abstract = {Sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes is mediated by signals present within the cytosolic domains of the proteins. Most signals consist of short, linear sequences of amino acid residues. Some signals are referred to as tyrosine-based sorting signals and conform to the NPXY or YXXO consensus motifs. Other signals known as dileucine-based signals fit [DE]XXXL[LI] or DXXLL consensus motifs. All of these signals are recognized by components of protein coats peripherally associated with the cytosolic face of membranes. YXXO and [DE]XXXL[LI] signals are recognized with characteristic fine specificity by the adaptor protein (AP) complexes AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4, whereas DXXLL signals are recognized by another family of adaptors known as GGAs. Several proteins, including clathrin, AP-2, and Dab2, have been proposed to function as recognition proteins for NPXY signals. YXXO and DXXLL signals bind in an extended conformation to the mu2 subunit of AP-2 and the VHS domain of the GGAs, respectively. Phosphorylation events regulate signal recognition. In addition to peptide motifs, ubiquitination of cytosolic lysine residues also serves as a signal for sorting at various stages of the endosomal-lysosomal system. Conjugated ubiquitin is recognized by UIM, UBA, or UBC domains present within many components of the internalization and lysosomal targeting machinery. This complex array of signals and recognition proteins ensures the dynamic but accurate distribution of transmembrane proteins to different compartments of the endosomal-lysosomal system.},

Since IDRs lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, the mechanism by which such mutations cause disease is often unknown. Here, we employ a proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1 and CACNA1H) lead to an increased binding of clathrins. In all three cases, the mutation creates a dileucine motif known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), a glucose transporter involved in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in cytosolic tails of transmembrane proteins. Dileucine motif gains thus appear to be a recurrent cause of disease.},

	Abstract = {Both heterotypic and homotypic fusion events are required to deliver endocytosed macromolecules to lysosomes and remodel late endocytic organelles. A trans-SNARE complex consisting of Q-SNAREs syntaxin 7, Vti1b and syntaxin 8 and the R-SNARE VAMP8 has been shown by others to be responsible for homotypic fusion of late endosomes. Using antibody inhibition experiments in rat liver cell-free systems, we confirmed this result, but found that the same Q-SNAREs can combine with an alternative R-SNARE, namely VAMP7, for heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated separate syntaxin 7 complexes with either VAMP7 or VAMP8 in solubilized rat liver membranes. Additionally, overexpression of the N-terminal domain of VAMP7, in cultured fibroblastic cells, inhibited the mixing of a preloaded lysosomal content marker with a marker delivered to late endosomes. These data show that combinatorial interactions of SNAREs determine whether late endosomes undergo homotypic or heterotypic fusion events.},

	Abstract = {Sets of SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion by assembling into core complexes. Multiple SNAREs are thought to function in different intracellular trafficking steps but it is often unclear which of the SNAREs cooperate in individual fusion reactions. We report that syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, vti1b and endobrevin/VAMP-8 form a complex that functions in the fusion of late endosomes. Antibodies specific for each protein coprecipitate the complex, inhibit homotypic fusion of late endosomes in vitro and retard delivery of endocytosed epidermal growth factor to lysosomes. The purified proteins form core complexes with biochemical and biophysical properties remarkably similar to the neuronal core complex, although each of the four proteins carries a transmembrane domain and three have independently folded N-terminal domains. Substitution experiments, sequence and structural comparisons revealed that each protein occupies a unique position in the complex, with syntaxin 7 corresponding to syntaxin 1, and vti1b and syntaxin 8 corresponding to the N- and C-terminal domains of SNAP-25, respectively. We conclude that the structure of core complexes and their molecular mechanism in membrane fusion is highly conserved between distant SNAREs.},

In vitro experiments suggest distinct functions for vtila and vtilb. Here we compared the subcellular localization of endogenous vtila and vtilb by immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy. Both proteins had a distinct but overlapping localization. vtila was found predominantly on the Golgi and the TGN, vtilb mostly on tubules and vesicles in the TGN area and on endosomes. vti1a coimmunoprecipitated with VAMP-4, syntaxin 6, and syntaxin 16. These four SNAREs could assemble into a SNARE complex of conserved structure because one SNARE motif of each subgroup is present. vtila-beta, VAMP-4, syntaxin 6, and syntaxin 16 are coenriched with small synaptic vesicles and with clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from rat brain synaptosomes. Therefore, this SNARE complex may have a role in synaptic vesicle biogenesis or recycling.},

	Abstract = {Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are transported from endosomes to the Golgi after delivering lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic pathway. This process requires Rab9 guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) and the putative tether GCC185. We show in human cells that a soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex comprised of syntaxin 10 (STX10), STX16, Vti1a, and VAMP3 is required for this MPR transport but not for the STX6-dependent transport of TGN46 or cholera toxin from early endosomes to the Golgi. Depletion of STX10 leads to MPR missorting and hypersecretion of hexosaminidase. Mouse and rat cells lack STX10 and, thus, must use a different target membrane SNARE for this process. GCC185 binds directly to STX16 and is competed by Rab6. These data support a model in which the GCC185 tether helps Rab9-bearing transport vesicles deliver their cargo to the trans-Golgi and suggest that Rab GTPases can regulate SNARE-tether interactions. Importantly, our data provide a clear molecular distinction between the transport of MPRs and TGN46 to the trans-Golgi.},

They degrade extracellular material that has been internalized by endocytosis and intracellular components that have been sequestered by autophagy. In addition, specialized cells contain lysosome-related organelles that store and secrete proteins for cell-type-specific functions. The functioning of a healthy cell is dependent on the proper targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal proteins. Accumulating evidence suggests that there are multiple lysosomal delivery pathways that together allow the regulated and sequential deposition of lysosomal components. The importance of lysosomal trafficking pathways is emphasized by recent findings that reveal new roles for lysosomal membrane proteins in cellular physiology and in an increasing number of diseases that are characterized by defects in lysosome biogenesis.},

Although much of our understanding of endocytic recycling has come from studies on the transferrin receptor, a protein internalized through clathrin-dependent endocytosis, increased interest in clathrin-independent endocytosis has led to the discovery of new endocytic recycling systems. Recent insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control endocytic recycling have focused on recycling through tubular carriers and the return to the cell surface of cargoes that enter cells through clathrin-independent mechanisms. Recent work emphasizes the importance of regulated recycling in processes as diverse as cytokinesis, cell adhesion, morphogenesis, cell fusion, learning and memory.},

	Abstract = {The molecular mechanisms ensuring directionality of endocytic membrane trafficking between transport vesicles and target organelles still remain poorly characterized. We have been investigating the function of the small GTPase Rab5 in early endocytic transport. In vitro studies have demonstrated a role of Rab5 in two membrane fusion events: the heterotypic fusion between plasma membrane-derived clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and early endosomes and in the homotypic fusion between early endosomes. Several Rab5 effectors are required in homotypic endosome fusion, including EEA1, which mediates endosome membrane docking, as well as Rabaptin-5 x Rabex-5 complex and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVPS34. In this study we have examined the localization and function of Rab5 and its effectors in heterotypic fusion in vitro. We report that the presence of active Rab5 is necessary on both CCVs and early endosomes for a heterotypic fusion event to occur. This process requires EEA1 in addition to the Rabaptin-5 complex. However, whereas Rab5 and Rabaptin-5 are symmetrically distributed between CCVs and early endosomes, EEA1 is recruited selectively onto the membrane of early endosomes. Our results suggest that EEA1 is a tethering molecule that provides directionality to vesicular transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes.},

	Abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) regulate blood and lymph vessel development by activating 3 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, and by binding to coreceptors such as neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). We investigated how different VEGF-A isoforms, in particular VEGF-A(165)a and VEGF-A(165)b, control the balance between VEGFR-2 recycling, degradation, and signaling. Stimulation of cells with the NRP-1-binding VEGF-A(165)a led to sequential NRP-1-mediated VEGFR-2 recycling through Rab5, Rab4, and Rab11 vesicles. Recycling was accompanied by dephosphorylation of VEGFR-2 between Rab4 and Rab11 vesicles and quantitatively and qualitatively altered signal output. In cells stimulated with VEGF-A(165)b, an isoform unable to bind NRP-1, VEGFR-2 bypassed Rab11 vesicles and was routed to the degradative pathway specified by Rab7 vesicles. Deletion of the GIPC (synectin) binding motif of NRP-1 prevented transition of VEGFR-2 through Rab11 vesicles and attenuated signaling. Coreceptor engagement was specific for VEGFR-2 because EGFR recycled through Rab11 vesicles in the absence of known coreceptors. Our data establish a distinct role of NRP-1 in VEGFR-2 signaling and reveal a general mechanism for the function of coreceptors in modulating RTK signal output.},

We have cloned a human cDNA encoding an evolutionarily conserved 180-kDa protein on early endosomes named EEA1 (Early Endosome Antigen1). EEA1 is associated with early endosomes since it co-localizes by immunofluorescence with the transferrin receptor and with Rab5 but not with Rab7. Immunoelectron microscopy shows that it is associated with tubulovesicular early endosomes containing internalized bovine serum albumin-gold. EEA1 is a hydrophilic peripheral membrane protein present in cytosol and membrane fractions. It partitions in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 solubilization and is extracted from membranes by 0.3 M NaCl. It is a predominantly α-helical protein sharing 17-20% sequence identity with the myosins and contains a calmodulin-binding IQ motif. It is flanked by metal-binding, cysteine “finger” motifs. The COOH-terminal fingers, Cys-X2-Cys-X-Cys-X2-Cys and Cys-X2-Cys-X-Cys-X2-Cys, are present within a region that is strikingly homologous with Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAB1 protein required for endocytosis and with Caenorhabditis elegans ZK632. These fingers also show limited conservation with S. cerevisiae VAC1, Vps11, and Vps18p proteins implicated in vacuolar transport. We propose that EEA1 is required for vesicular transport of proteins through early endosomes and that its finger motifs are required for this activity.},

	Abstract = {EEA1 is an early endosomal Rab5 effector protein that has been implicated in the docking of incoming endocytic vesicles before fusion with early endosomes. Because of the presence of complex endosomal pathways in polarized and nonpolarized cells, we have examined the distribution of EEA1 in diverse cell types. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that EEA1 is present on a subdomain of the early sorting endosome but not on clathrin-coated vesicles, consistent with a role in providing directionality to early endosomal fusion. Furthermore, EEA1 is associated with filamentous material that extends from the cytoplasmic surface of the endosomal domain, which is also consistent with a tethering/docking role for EEA1. In polarized cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and hippocampal neurons), EEA1 is present on a subset of ``basolateral-type'' endosomal compartments, suggesting that EEA1 regulates specific endocytic pathways. In both epithelial cells and fibroblastic cells, EEA1 and a transfected apical endosomal marker, endotubin, label distinct endosomal populations. Hence, there are at least two distinct sets of early endosomes in polarized and nonpolarized mammalian cells. EEA1 could provide specificity and directionality to fusion events occurring in a subset of these endosomes in polarized and nonpolarized cells.},

	Abstract = {The kinetics of association of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and diferric-transferrin (TF) with clathrin-coated membranes of KB cells were examined using anti-clathrin antibody bound to Staphylococcus aureus. The ligands were bound to cells at 4 degrees C and after warming to 30 degrees C for 5 min, both ligands were found concentrated in a membrane fraction immunoadsorbed with anti-clathrin antibody. Fifteen minutes after entry both ligands moved to a non-clathrin-associated compartment. Twenty to 25 min after entry, EGF, but not TF, appeared in a second clathrin-associated compartment. In parallel morphologic experiments, EGF-horseradish peroxidase (EGF-HRP) and TF-HRP were both found at 6 min in coated pits associated with the plasma membrane. At 22 min EGF-HRP, but not TF-HRP, was localized in Golgi-associated coated pits. These studies provide biochemical and morphological evidence suggesting that coated membranes in the Golgi region are involved at some stage in the transfer of EGF to lysosomes. The method should be of general utility in the study of receptor-mediated endocytosis.},

	Url = {http://www.pnas.org/content/93/18/9559.abstract N2 - During receptor mediated endocytosis, at least a fraction of recycling cargo typically accumulates in a pericentriolar cluster of tubules and vesicles. However, it is not clear if these endosomal structures are biochemically distinct from the early endosomes from which they are derived. To better characterize this pericentriolar endosome population, we determined the distribution of two endogenous proteins known to be functionally involved in receptor recycling [Rab4, cellubrevin (Cbvn)] relative to the distribution of a recycling ligand [transferrin (Tfn)] as it traversed the endocytic pathway. Shortly after internalization, Tfn entered a population of early endosomes that contained both Rab4 and Cbvn, demonstrated by triple label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Tfn then accumulated in the pericentriolar cluster of recycling vesicles (RVs). However, although these pericentriolar endosomes contained Cbvn, they were strikingly depleted of Rab4. The ability of internalized Tfn to reach the Rab4-negative population was not blocked by nocodazole, although the characteristic pericentriolar location of the population was not maintained in the absence of microtubules. Similarly, Rab4-positive and -negative populations remained distinct in cells treated with brefeldin A, with only Rab4-positive elements exhibiting the extended tubular morphology induced by the drug. Thus, at least with respect to Rab4 distribution, the pathway of Tfn receptor recycling consists of at least two biochemically and functionally distinct populations of endosomes, a Rab4-positive population of early endosomes to which incoming Tfn is initially delivered and a Rab4-negative population of recycling vesicles that transiently accumulates Tfn on its route back to the plasma membrane.},

We report in the accompanying article (Byrd, J. C., and MacDonald, R. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 18638–18646) that only one of the two extracytoplasmic mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) binding domains is necessary for high affinity Man-6-P ligand binding, suggesting that, like the cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor, oligomerization of the IGF2R contributes to high affinity interaction with lysosomal enzymes. In the present study, we have directly characterized both naturally occurring and engineered forms of the IGF2R for their ability to form oligomeric structures. Whereas gel filtration chromatography suggested that purified bovine IGF2R species exist in a monomeric form, native gel electrophoresis allowed for the separation of dimeric and monomeric forms of the receptors with distinct phosphomannosyl ligand binding characteristics. The ability of the IGF2R to form oligomeric complexes was confirmed and localized to the extracytoplasmic domain through the use of epitope-tagged soluble IGF2R constructs bearing deletions of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Finally, chimeric receptors were engineered containing the extracytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the IGF2R fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor with which dimerization of the chimeras could be monitored by measuring autophosphorylation. Collectively, these results show that the IGF2R is capable of forming oligomeric complexes, most likely dimers, in the absence of Man-6-P ligands.},

We investigated two such proteins, epsinR and gadkin, using the knocksideways method, which rapidly depletes proteins from the available pool by trapping them onto mitochondria. Although epsinR is known to be an N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-specific adaptor, the epsinR knocksideways blocked the production of the entire population of intracellular clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), suggesting a more global function. Using the epsinR knocksideways data, we were able to estimate the copy number of all major intracellular CCV proteins. Both sides of the vesicle are densely covered, indicating that CCVs sort their cargo by molecular crowding. Trapping of gadkin onto mitochondria also blocked the production of intracellular CCVs but by a different mechanism: vesicles became cross-linked to mitochondria and pulled out toward the cell periphery. Both phenotypes provide new insights into the regulation of intracellular CCV formation, which could not have been found using more conventional approaches.},

@article{Kalthoff,
	Abstract = {We have characterized a novel clathrin-binding 68-kDa epsin N-terminal homology domain (ENTH-domain) protein that we name clathrin interacting protein localized in the trans-Golgi region (Clint). It localizes predominantly to the Golgi region of epithelial cells as well as to more peripheral vesicular structures. Clint colocalizes with AP-1 and clathrin only in the perinuclear area. Recombinantly expressed Clint interacts directly with the gamma-appendage domain of AP-1, with the clathrin N-terminal domain through the peptide motif (423)LFDLM, with the gamma-adaptin ear homology domain of Golgi-localizing, gamma-adaptin ear homology domain 2, with the appendage domain of beta2-adaptin and to a lesser extent with the appendage domain of alpha-adaptin. Moreover, the Clint ENTH-domain asssociates with phosphoinositide-containing liposomes. A significant amount of Clint copurifies with rat liver clathrin-coated vesicles. In rat kidney it is preferentially expressed in the apical region of epithelial cells that line the collecting duct. Clathrin and Clint also colocalize in the apical region of enterocytes along the villi of the small intestine. Apart from the ENTH-domain Clint has no similarities with the epsins AP180/CALM or Hip1/1R. A notable feature of Clint is a carboxyl-terminal methionine-rich domain (Met(427)-Met(605)), which contains >17% methionine. Our results suggest that Clint might participate in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the level of the trans-Golgi network and remains associated with the vesicles longer than clathrin and adaptors.},

@article{Rojas,
	Abstract = {The retromer is a cytosolic/peripheral membrane protein complex that mediates the retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in mammalian cells. Previous studies showed that the mammalian retromer comprises three proteins, named Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35, plus the sorting nexin, SNX1. There is conflicting evidence, however, as to whether a homologous sorting nexin, SNX2, is truly a component of the retromer. In addition, the nature of the subunit interactions and assembly of the mammalian retromer complex are poorly understood. We have addressed these issues by performing biochemical and functional analyses of endogenous retromers in the human cell line HeLa. We found that the mammalian retromer complex consists of two autonomously assembling subcomplexes, namely, a Vps26-Vps29-Vps35 obligate heterotrimer and a SNX1/2 alternative heterodimer or homodimer. The association of Vps26-Vps29-Vps35 with endosomes requires the presence of either SNX1 or SNX2, whereas SNX1/2 can be recruited to endosomes independently of Vps26-Vps29-Vps35. We also found that the presence of either SNX1 or SNX2 is essential for the retrieval of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor to the TGN. These observations indicate that the mammalian retromer complex assembles by sequential association of SNX1/2 and Vps26-Vps29-Vps35 subcomplexes on endosomal membranes and that SNX1 and SNX2 play interchangeable but essential roles in retromer structure and function.},

@article{Costes,
	Abstract = {We introduce a novel statistical approach that quantifies, for the first time, the amount of colocalization of two fluorescent-labeled proteins in an image automatically, removing the bias of visual interpretation. This is done by estimating simultaneously the maximum threshold of intensity for each color below which pixels do not show any statistical correlation. The sensitivity of the method was illustrated on simulated data by statistically confirming the existence of true colocalization in images with as little as 3{\%} colocalization. This method was then tested on a large three-dimensional set of fixed cells cotransfected with CFP/YFP pairs of proteins that either co-compartmentalized, interacted, or were just randomly localized in the nucleolus. In this test, the algorithm successfully distinguished random color overlap from colocalization due to either co-compartmentalization or interaction, and results were verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The accuracy and consistency of our algorithm was further illustrated by measuring, for the first time in live cells, the dissociation rate (k(d)) of the HIV-1 Rev/CRM1 export complex induced by the cytotoxin leptomycin B. Rev/CRM1 colocalization in nucleoli dropped exponentially after addition of leptomycin B at a rate of 1.25 ×10(−3) s(−1). More generally, this algorithm can be used to answer a variety of biological questions involving protein-protein interactions or co-compartmentalization and can be generalized to colocalization of more than two colors.},

@article{He,
	Abstract = {The solute-carrier gene (SLC) superfamily encodes membrane-bound transporters. The SLC superfamily comprises 55 gene families having at least 362 putatively functional protein-coding genes. The gene products include passive transporters, symporters and antiporters, located in all cellular and organelle membranes, except, perhaps, the nuclear membrane. Transport substrates include amino acids and oligopeptides, glucose and other sugars, inorganic cations and anions (H(+), HCO(3)(-), Cl(-), Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), PO(4)(3-), HPO(4)(2-), H(2)PO(4)(-), SO(4)(2-), C(2)O(4)(2-), OH(-),CO(3)(2-)), bile salts, carboxylate and other organic anions, acetyl coenzyme A, essential metals, biogenic amines, neurotransmitters, vitamins, fatty acids and lipids, nucleosides, ammonium, choline, thyroid hormone and urea. Contrary to gene nomenclature commonly assigned on the basis of evolutionary divergence http://www.genenames.org/, the SLC gene superfamily has been named based largely on transporter function by proteins having multiple transmembrane domains. Whereas all the transporters exist for endogenous substrates, it is likely that drugs, non-essential metals and many other environmental toxicants are able to 'hitch-hike' on one or another of these transporters, thereby enabling these moieties to enter (or leave) the cell. Understanding and characterising the functions of these transporters is relevant to medicine, genetics, developmental biology, pharmacology and cancer chemotherapy.},

@article{Dong,
	Abstract = {Focal adhesions are protein complexes that link metazoan cells to the extracellular matrix through the integrin family of transmembrane proteins. Integrins recruit many proteins to these complexes, referred to as the "adhesome." We used proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) in U2OS osteosarcoma cells to label proteins within 15 to 25 nm of paxillin, a cytoplasmic focal adhesion protein, and kindlin-2, which directly binds beta integrins. Using mass spectrometry analysis of the biotinylated proteins, we identified 27 known adhesome proteins and 8 previously unknown components close to paxillin. However, only seven of these proteins interacted directly with paxillin, one of which was the adaptor protein Kank2. The proteins in proximity to beta integrin included 15 of the adhesion proteins identified in the paxillin BioID data set. BioID also correctly established kindlin-2 as a cell-cell junction protein. By focusing on this smaller data set, new partners for kindlin-2 were found, namely, the endocytosis-promoting proteins liprin beta1 and EFR3A, but, contrary to previous reports, not the filamin-binding protein migfilin. A model adhesome based on both data sets suggests that focal adhesions contain fewer components than previously suspected and that paxillin lies away from the plasma membrane. These data not only illustrate the power of using BioID and stable isotope-labeled mass spectrometry to define macromolecular complexes but also enable the correct identification of therapeutic targets within the adhesome.},

By fusing a promiscuous biotin ligase to a protein of interest expressed in living cells, BioID permits the labeling of proximate proteins during a defined labeling period. In this study we used BioID to study the human nuclear pore complex (NPC), one of the largest macromolecular assemblies in eukaryotes. Anchored within the nuclear envelope, NPCs mediate the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of numerous cellular components. We applied BioID to constituents of the Nup107–160 complex and the Nup93 complex, two conserved NPC subcomplexes. A strikingly different set of NPC constituents was detected depending on the position of these BioID-fusion proteins within the NPC. By applying BioID to several constituents located throughout the extremely stable Nup107–160 subcomplex, we refined our understanding of this highly conserved subcomplex, in part by demonstrating a direct interaction of Nup43 with Nup85. Furthermore, by using the extremely stable Nup107–160 structure as a molecular ruler, we defined the practical labeling radius of BioID. These studies further our understanding of human NPC organization and demonstrate that BioID is a valuable tool for exploring the constituency and organization of large protein assemblies in living cells.},

	Abstract = {A main bottleneck in proteomics is the downstream biological analysis of highly multivariate quantitative protein abundance data generated using mass-spectrometry-based analysis. We developed the Perseus software platform (http://www.perseus-framework.org) to support biological and biomedical researchers in interpreting protein quantification, interaction and post-translational modification data. Perseus contains a comprehensive portfolio of statistical tools for high-dimensional omics data analysis covering normalization, pattern recognition, time-series analysis, cross-omics comparisons and multiple-hypothesis testing. A machine learning module supports the classification and validation of patient groups for diagnosis and prognosis, and it also detects predictive protein signatures. Central to Perseus is a user-friendly, interactive workflow environment that provides complete documentation of computational methods used in a publication. All activities in Perseus are realized as plugins, and users can extend the software by programming their own, which can be shared through a plugin store. We anticipate that Perseus's arsenal of algorithms and its intuitive usability will empower interdisciplinary analysis of complex large data sets.},

	Abstract = {Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a well-characterized plasma membrane protein that travels between the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments. Although TfR itself should undergo degradation, the same as other intracellular proteins, whether a specific TfR degradation pathway exists has never been investigated. In this study, we screened small GTPase Rab proteins, common regulators of membrane traffic in all eukaryotes, for proteins that are specifically involved in TfR degradation. We performed the screening by three sequential methods, i.e. colocalization of Rab with TfR, colocalization with lysosomes, and knockdown of Rab by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), and succeeded in identifying Rab12, a previously uncharacterized Rab isoform, as a prime candidate among the 60 human or mouse Rabs screened. We showed that expression of a constitutive active mutant of Rab12 reduced the amount of TfR protein, whereas functional ablation of Rab12 by knockdown of either Rab12 itself or its upstream activator Dennd3 increased the amount of TfR protein. Interestingly, however, knockdown of Rab12 had no effect on the degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein, i.e. on a conventional degradation pathway. Our findings indicated that TfR is constitutively degraded by a Rab12-dependent pathway (presumably from recycling endosomes to lysosomes), which is independent of the conventional degradation pathway.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) have greatly advanced our understanding of the important role this protein plays in the establishment and progression of inflammatory disease. To facilitate more detailed studies on the function of VAP-1, we developed a GFP-fusion protein that enabled us to monitor the trafficking of the protein in three selected cell types: hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, liver myofibroblasts and an hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2). The fusion protein was detected as punctate cytoplasmic GFP staining, but was present only at low levels at the cell surface in all cell types studied. The subcellular distribution of the protein was not altered in a catalytically inactive mutant form of the protein (Tyr471Phe) or in the presence of exogenous VAP-1 substrate (methylamine) or inhibitor (semicarbazide). The GFP-VAP-1 protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus (GM-130), endoplasmic reticulum (GRP94) and early endosomes (EEA-1). Additional staining for VAP-1 revealed that the overexpressed protein was also present in vesicles that were negative for GFP fluorescent signal and did not express EEA-1. We propose that these vesicles are responsible for recycling the fusion protein and that the fluorescence of the GFP moiety is quenched at the low pH within these vesicles. This feature of the protein makes it well suited for live cell imaging studies where we wish to track protein that is being actively trafficked within the cell in preference to that which is being recycled.},

@article{Senkel,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To analyze gene function in mammalian cells tetracycline inducible expression of a gene-of-interest at a specific genomic location (Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}) is most attractive. However, leakiness of basal transgene expression and artificially high expression level upon tetracycline addition may be disadvantageous. FINDINGS: To solve these problems, we developed two different approaches to improve our pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}expressing the tissue restricted transcription factor HNF4αunder control of tetracycline. On the one hand we replaced the strong full length CMV promoter (CMV-Wt) with a weaker 5'-deleted CMV promoter fragment of 138 nucleotides in length (CMV-138). On the other hand we extended our INS-1 Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}cell lines with a Shield-1 dependent conditional control system of protein stability. Therefore, we fused HNF4αto the destabilization domain (DD) deduced from human FKBP12 protein. As a result in both approaches basal transgene expression level was markedly reduced, but HNF4αinduction could still be maintained. Additionally, we could show that a low increase in HNF4αinduces caspase activity indicating an apoptotic effect of HNF4αin these cells. CONCLUSION: In the present study we considerably improved our INS-1 Flp-In T-REx{\texttrademark}cell lines conditionally expressing HNF4αto reduce leakiness and to optimize exogenous HNF4αprotein expression to a physiological level. As an important result we could extend our previous results that HNF4αinduces apoptosis in the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 with the new aspect that an expression level of the HNF4αtransgene marginally exceeding the endogenous level is sufficient to trigger apoptosis.},

@article{Pham,
	Abstract = {Tetracycline-regulated expression systems have been widely used for inducible protein expression in cultured mammalian cells. With these systems, however, leakiness in expression of the target gene in the absence of the inducing agent is a frequent problem. Here we describe a novel approach to overcome this problem that involves the incorporation of AU-rich mRNA destabilizing elements (AREs) into the 3' untranslated regions of the tetracycline-inducible constructs. Using the inducible expression of sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 in HEK293 cells as model systems, we found this ARE approach to be remarkably successful in ablating expression of these proteins in the absence of doxycycline through decreasing stability of their mRNAs. We show that this undemanding and flexible process results in a substantial decrease in the leakiness of the tetracycline-inducible expression system while maintaining a high level of target protein expression following induction.},

@article{Yamamoto,
	Abstract = {We studied the effects of bafilomycin A1, a potent and specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), on the process of autophagy in rat hepatoma cell line, H-4-II-E cells. To induce autophagy, cells were transferred from Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 12% fetal calf serum into Hanks' balanced salt solution. When bafilomycin A1 was added to Hanks' balanced salt solution, endogenous protein degradation was strongly inhibited and numerous autophagosomes accumulated in H-4-II-E cells, whereas autolysosomes decreased in number. Acid phosphatase activity was not detected in the autophagosomes which accumulated in the presence of bafilomycin A1, suggesting that fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes was disturbed by this drug. Inhibition of the fusion was reversible, and the autophagosomes changed into autolysosomes after the removal of the inhibitor. Bafilomycin A1 also prevented the appearance of endocytosed HRP in autophagic vacuoles. These results suggested that acidification of the lumenal space of autophagosomes or lysosomes by V-ATPase is important for the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.},

@article{Tanida,
	Abstract = {During starvation-induced autophagy in mammals, autophagosomes form and fuse with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of the intra-autophagosomal contents by lysosomal proteases. During the formation of autophagosomes, LC3 is lipidated, and this LC3-phospholipid conjugate (LC3-II) is localized on autophagosomes and autolysosomes. While intra-autophagosomal LC3-II may be degraded by lysosomal hydrolases, recent studies have regarded LC3-II accumulation as marker of autophagy. The effect of lysosomal turnover of endogenous LC3-II in this process, however, has not been considered. We therefore investigated the lysosomal turnover of endogenous LC3-II during starvation-induced autophagy using E64d and pepstatin A, which inhibit lysosomal proteases, including cathepsins B, D and L. We found that endogenous LC3-II significantly accumulated in the presence of E64d and pepstatin A under starvation conditions, increasing about 3.5 fold in HEK293 cells and about 6.7 fold in HeLa cells compared with that in their absence, whereas the amount of LC3-II in their absence is cell-line dependent. Morphological analyses indicated that endogenous LC3-positive puncta and autolysosomes increased in HeLa cells under starvation conditions in the presence of these inhibitors. These results indicate that endogenous LC3-II is considerably degraded by lysosomal hydrolases after formation of autolysosomes, and suggest that lysosomal turnover, not a transient amount, of this protein reflects starvation-induced autophagic activity.},

@article{Hillen,
	Abstract = {Tetracycline-resistance determinants encoding active efflux of the drug are widely distributed in gram-negative bacteria and unique with respect to genetic organization and regulation of expression. Each determinant consists of two genes called tetA and tetR, which are oriented with divergent polarity, and between them is a central regulatory region with overlapping promoters and operators. The amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins are 43-78% identical. The resistance protein TetA is a tetracycline/metal-proton antiporter located in the cytoplasmic membrane, while the regulatory protein TetR is a tetracycline inducible repressor. TetR binds via a helix-turn-helix motif to the two tet operators, resulting in repression of both genes. A detailed model of the repressor-operator complex has been proposed on the basis of biochemical and genetic data. The tet genes are differentially regulated so that repressor synthesis can occur before the resistance protein is expressed. This has been demonstrated for the Tn10-encoded tet genes and may be a common property of all tet determinants, as suggested by the similar locations of operators with respect to promoters. Induction is mediated by a tetracycline-metal complex and requires only nanomolar concentrations of the drug. This is the most sensitive effector-inducible system of transcriptional regulation known to date. The crystal structure of the TetR-tetracycline/metal complex shows the Tet repressor in the induced, non-DNA binding conformation. The structural interpretation of many noninducible TetR mutants has offered insight into the conformational changes associated with the switch between inducing and repressing structures of TetR. Tc is buried in the core of TetR, where it is held in place by multiple contacts to the protein.},

Before performing the analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS), nanoelectrospray-MS/MS (NanoES-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-MS/MS (LC-MS/MS), the peptide mixtures need to be cleaned, concentrated and often selectively enriched or pre-fractionated, for which we employ simple, self-made and extremely economical stop-and-go-extraction tips (StageTips). StageTips are ordinary pipette tips containing very small disks made of beads with reversed phase, cation-exchange or anion-exchange surfaces embedded in a Teflon mesh. The fixed nature of the beads allows flexible combination of disks with different surfaces to obtain multi-functional tips. Disks containing different surface functionalities and loose beads such as titania and zirconia for phosphopeptide enrichment can be combined. Incorporation into an automated workflow has also been demonstrated. Desalting and concentration takes approximately 5 min while fractionation or enrichment takes approximately 30 min.},

	Abstract = {Protein quantification without isotopic labels has been a long-standing interest in the proteomics field. However, accurate and robust proteome-wide quantification with label-free approaches remains a challenge. We developed a new intensity determination and normalization procedure called MaxLFQ that is fully compatible with any peptide or protein separation prior to LC-MS analysis. Protein abundance profiles are assembled using the maximum possible information from MS signals, given that the presence of quantifiable peptides varies from sample to sample. For a benchmark dataset with two proteomes mixed at known ratios, we accurately detected the mixing ratio over the entire protein expression range, with greater precision for abundant proteins. The significance of individual label-free quantifications was obtained via a t test approach. For a second benchmark dataset, we accurately quantify fold changes over several orders of magnitude, a task that is challenging with label-based methods. MaxLFQ is a generic label-free quantification technology that is readily applicable to many biological questions; it is compatible with standard statistical analysis workflows, and it has been validated in many and diverse biological projects. Our algorithms can handle very large experiments of 500+ samples in a manageable computing time. It is implemented in the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform and works completely seamlessly at the click of a button.},

@article{Couzens,
	Abstract = {The Hippo pathway regulates organ size and tissue homeostasis in response to multiple stimuli, including cell density and mechanotransduction. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatases can also stimulate Hippo signaling in cell culture. We defined the Hippo protein-protein interaction network with and without inhibition of serine and threonine phosphatases by okadaic acid. We identified 749 protein interactions, including 599 previously unrecognized interactions, and demonstrated that several interactions with serine and threonine phosphatases were phosphorylation-dependent. Mutation of the T-loop of MST2 (mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 2), which prevented autophosphorylation, disrupted its association with STRIPAK (striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex). Deletion of the amino-terminal forkhead-associated domain of SLMAP (sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein), a component of the STRIPAK complex, prevented its association with MST1 and MST2. Phosphatase inhibition produced temporally distinct changes in proteins that interacted with MOB1A and MOB1B (Mps one binder kinase activator-like 1A and 1B) and promoted interactions with upstream Hippo pathway proteins, such as MST1 and MST2, and with the trimeric protein phosphatase 6 complex (PP6). Mutation of three basic amino acids that are part of a phospho-serine- and phospho-threonine-binding domain in human MOB1B prevented its interaction with MST1 and PP6 in cells treated with okadaic acid. Collectively, our results indicated that changes in phosphorylation orchestrate interactions between kinases and phosphatases in Hippo signaling, providing a putative mechanism for pathway regulation.},

	Abstract = {Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) can occur in isolation or in association with epilepsy, but the genetic causes and pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. We performed a clinical evaluation and genetic analysis in a five-generation family with co-occurrence of PED and epilepsy (n = 39), suggesting that this combination represents a clinical entity. Based on a whole genome linkage analysis we screened SLC2A1, encoding the glucose transporter of the blood-brain-barrier, GLUT1 and identified heterozygous missense and frameshift mutations segregating in this and three other nuclear families with a similar phenotype. PED was characterized by choreoathetosis, dystonia or both, affecting mainly the legs. Predominant epileptic seizure types were primary generalized. A median CSF/blood glucose ratio of 0.52 (normal >0.60) in the patients and a reduced glucose uptake by mutated transporters compared with the wild-type as determined in Xenopus oocytes confirmed a pathogenic role of these mutations. Functional imaging studies implicated alterations in glucose metabolism in the corticostriate pathways in the pathophysiology of PED and in the frontal lobe cortex in the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures. Three patients were successfully treated with a ketogenic diet. In conclusion, co-occurring PED and epilepsy can be due to autosomal dominant heterozygous SLC2A1 mutations, expanding the phenotypic spectrum associated with GLUT1 deficiency and providing a potential new treatment option for this clinical syndrome.},

Patients present with an early-onset epilepsy resistant to anticonvulsants, developmental delay, and a complex movement disorder. Hypotonic, ataxic, and dystonic features are most prominent. Speech is often severely affected. Some patients develop spasticity and secondary microcephaly. The phenotype is highly variable ranging from severe impairment to children without seizures. Electroencephalography (EEG) may show 2.5-4Hz spike-waves improving on food intake. Neuroimaging is uninformative. Most patients carry heterozygous de novo mutations in the GLUT1 gene (OMIM 138140, gene map locus 1p35-31.3). Autosomal dominant transmission and several mutational hot spots have been identified, but phenotype-genotype correlations are not yet apparent. Homozygous GLUT1 mutations presumably are lethal. The ketogenic diet is the treatment of choice as it provides an alternative fuel to the brain. It should be introduced early and maintained into puberty. Seizures are effectively controlled with the onset of ketosis, but might recur and require comedication. The effect on neurodevelopment appears less impressive. The increasing number of patients, molecular and biochemical analysis, recent research into ketogenic diet mechanisms, and the development of animal models for GLUT1DS have brought substantial insights in disease manifestations and mechanisms. This review summarizes data on 84 published cases and highlights recent advances in understanding this entity.},

	N2 = {GLUT1 deficiency is caused by a defect in the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1. Impaired glucose transport across brain tissue barriers is reflected by hypoglycorrhachia and results in an epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delay and motor disorders. Recently heterozygous mutations in the GLUT1 gene (1p35--31.3) have been reported in sporadic patients. Parents and siblings carried the GLUT1 wild-type, suggesting a de novo, autosomal dominant condition resulting from GLUT1 haploinsufficiency. We report a father and two children from separate marriages affected by GLUT1 deficiency and carrying a novel heterozygous missense mutation (G272A) in the GLUT1 gene. Mutations were identified by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing and confirmed by restriction fragment digest. The predicted amino acid change (Gly91Asp) affects an Arg-X-Gly-Arg-Arg motif between helices 2 and 3 that represents a cytoplasmic anchor point and is highly conserved among transporters of the major facilitator superfamily down to yeast and bacteria. GLUT1 immunoreactivity was normal, but 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake into erythrocytes was significantly reduced, suggesting a quantitatively normal, but functionally impaired, GLUT1 protein at the cell membrane. This is the first report of autosomal dominant transmission of GLUT1 deficiency, confirming that this condition is the result of haploinsufficiency. The Gly→Asp mutation within a highly conserved sequence highlights its importance for GLUT1 function. GLUT1 deficiency should be considered in patients with epilepsy, mental retardation and motor disorders. Our observations have bearing on the identification of this treatable disorder in pediatric and adult patients, will modify current biochemical protocols which use parental controls and will enable genetic counseling of affected families.},

@article{Leen,
	Abstract = {Glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome is caused by mutations in the SLC2A1 gene in the majority of patients and results in impaired glucose transport into the brain. From 2004-2008, 132 requests for mutational analysis of the SLC2A1 gene were studied by automated Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Mutations in the SLC2A1 gene were detected in 54 patients (41%) and subsequently in three clinically affected family members. In these 57 patients we identified 49 different mutations, including six multiple exon deletions, six known mutations and 37 novel mutations (13 missense, five nonsense, 13 frame shift, four splice site and two translation initiation mutations). Clinical data were retrospectively collected from referring physicians by means of a questionnaire. Three different phenotypes were recognized: (i) the classical phenotype (84%), subdivided into early-onset (<2 years) (65%) and late-onset (18%); (ii) a non-classical phenotype, with mental retardation and movement disorder, without epilepsy (15%); and (iii) one adult case of glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome with minimal symptoms. Recognizing glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome is important, since a ketogenic diet was effective in most of the patients with epilepsy (86%) and also reduced movement disorders in 48% of the patients with a classical phenotype and 71% of the patients with a non-classical phenotype. The average delay in diagnosing classical glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome was 6.6 years (range 1 month-16 years). Cerebrospinal fluid glucose was below 2.5 mmol/l (range 0.9-2.4 mmol/l) in all patients and cerebrospinal fluid : blood glucose ratio was below 0.50 in all but one patient (range 0.19-0.52). Cerebrospinal fluid lactate was low to normal in all patients. Our relatively large series of 57 patients with glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome allowed us to identify correlations between genotype, phenotype and biochemical data. Type of mutation was related to the severity of mental retardation and the presence of complex movement disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid : blood glucose ratio was related to type of mutation and phenotype. In conclusion, a substantial number of the patients with glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome do not have epilepsy. Our study demonstrates that a lumbar puncture provides the diagnostic clue to glucose transporter-1 deficiency syndrome and can thereby dramatically reduce diagnostic delay to allow early start of the ketogenic diet.},

	Abstract = {The glucose transporter is now identified but may have modifications or other subunits that control its activity. The kinetics and inhibitor binding studies are consistent with the carrier model with different degrees of asymmetry and a single binding site that varies in specificity depending on the conformation of the protein. The physical structure could actually be quite different from the usual diagrams (rocking bananas), however, and could function as a monomer or higher oligomer. The binding site, or filter, that gives specificity could be in the middle as usually depicted; alternatively it could be entirely on the cytoplasmic side, where the protein is trypsin sensitive, and hydrophobic helices could span the membrane forming a simple channel. Possible restrictions on structures in the membrane from the hydrophobic nature of transmembrane segments of membrane proteins (62) may favor a globular domain outside the membrane as the binding site. Such speculations will have to await more structural information about the transporter.},

@article{Uldry,
	Abstract = {The SLC2 family of glucose and polyol transporters comprises 13 members, the glucose transporters (GLUT) 1--12 and the H+-myo-inositol cotransporter (HMIT). These proteins all contain 12 transmembrane domains with both the amino and carboxy-terminal ends located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and a N-linked oligosaccharide side-chain located either on the first or fifth extracellular loop. Based on sequence comparison, the GLUT isoforms can be grouped into three classes: class I comprises GLUT1--4; class II, GLUT6, 8, 10, and 12 and class III, GLUT5, 7, 9, 11 and HMIT. Despite their sequence similarity and the presence of class-specific signature sequences, these transporters carry various hexoses and HMIT is a H+/myo-inositol co-transporter. Furthermore, the substrate transported by some isoforms has not yet been identified. Tissue- and cell-specific expression of the well-characterized GLUT isoforms underlies their specific role in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis. Numerous studies with transgenic or knockout mice indeed support an important role for these transporters in the control of glucose utilization, glucose storage and glucose sensing. Much remains to be learned about the transport functions of the recently discovered isoforms (GLUT6--13 and HMIT) and their physiological role in the metabolism of glucose, myo-inositol and perhaps other substrates.},

	Abstract = {Internalization and trafficking of cell-surface membrane receptors and proteins into subcellular compartments is mediated by specific short-sequence signal motifs, which are usually located within the cytoplasmic domains of these receptor and protein molecules. The signals usually consist of short linear amino acid sequences, which are recognized by adaptor coat proteins along the endocytic and sorting pathways. The complex arrays of signals and recognition proteins ensure the dynamic movement, accurate trafficking, and designated distribution of transmembrane receptors and ligands into intracellular compartments, particularly to the endosomal-lysosomal system. This review summarizes the new information and concepts, integrating them with the current and established views of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and sorting of membrane receptors and proteins. Particular emphasis has been given to the functional roles of short-sequence signal motifs responsible for the itinerary and destination of membrane receptors and proteins moving into the subcellular compartments. The specific characteristics and functions of short-sequence motifs, including various tyrosine-based, dileucine-type, and other short-sequence signals in the trafficking and sorting of membrane receptors and membrane proteins are presented and discussed.},
